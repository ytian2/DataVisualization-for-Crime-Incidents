    <th>Tips</th>   
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Blunt</td>
    <td>The choices are simple... Run away, or close the distance and strike while defending.</br>  Staying in range of the stick, but out of range to counter attack, is potentially the biggest mistake you could make in this situation.</br>  Remember, the stick will be moving fastest at the point furthest from the attackers arm, so getting inside that point on the stick is crucial.</td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Firearm</td>
    <td>Don't touch!</br>Leave the area.</br>Indoors, the overpressure from firing the gun has nowhere to go and is reflected back at you from the walls.</br>It can be conducted to your inner ear through the mastoid bone and do damage even though you don't feel anything.</br>You should probably use both muffs and plugs simultaneously and always get the highest rated ones you can find.</br></td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Knife</td>
    <td>If you can see the knife in hand and the attacker is some distance away – widen that distance, run away!</br> If there’s no where to run or you can’t leave the situation for some reason, then get something solid between you and the attacker (chair, baseball bat, rucksack, anything – just enough to distract him, so you can go to work on him).</br>Take careful note where his hands are and what he is doing with them.</br>If his hands are empty and you get in to a scuffle, he may reach in to his pocket and take a blade out and get use it – So, watch those hands – again if you have any training – trap the arms/hands while striking him.</br></td>   
  </tr>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Personal Weapon (hand foot etc.)</td>
    <td>If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse, DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM.</br> Toss it away from you....chances are that he is more interested in your wallet and/or purse than you, and he will go for the wallet/purse.</br> RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!</br> If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy.</br> The driver won't see you, but everybody else will. This has saved lives.</td>
